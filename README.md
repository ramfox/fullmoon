# fullmoon

## Goal
Fullmoon will be a hangman-like game that you can play with a friend over the distributed web. It will first be built using ipfs's libp2p, with the hopes to eventually allow communication using DAT protocols.

## Currently
Currently, fullmoon is a hangman-like game that allows you to enter a 'magic word' for your opponent to guess. This all happens on the same terminal.

Your opponent will then guess, letter by letter, the full word or phrase.

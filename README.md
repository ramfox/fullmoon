start:
explain game - You are a werewolf! Every full moon you turn into a monstrous, blood thirsty creature, bound to harm yourself and those around you. In order to escape this fate, you must come up with a secret word or phrase. If another werewolf can guess that phrase before the full moon they are spared their horrific ordeal for the month. But they too have a secret phrase, and if you can guess theirs first, then it is you who is spared. If neither of you can guess before the next full moon, you are both sentenced to the same fate: to endure a painful transformation, wreck havoc on the country side, and perhaps be gunned down by werewolf hunters and their silver bullets!
